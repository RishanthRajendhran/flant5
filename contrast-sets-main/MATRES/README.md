[MATRES](https://github.com/qiangning/MATRES) has a Platinum section which is the standard test set. This folder contains the minimal pairs we created for 239 instances in Platinum.

# File description:
- `Platinum_subset_minimal_pairs.csv`: The raw file that hosts minimal pair annotations from two experts
- `AnnotationCSV2XML.py`: Use Platinum_subset_minimal_pairs.csv to generate Platinum_subset_original.xml and Platinum_subset_perturbed.xml
- `Platinum_subset_original.xml` and `Platinum_subset_perturbed.xml`: Raw input files used in CogCompTime2.0 separately
- `proposed_elmo_lr0.001.original.output`: The model output we got from running CogCompTime2.0 on Platinum_subset_original.xml. The three columns are id, gold label, predicted label index ({"BEFORE": 0, "AFTER": 1, "EQUAL": 2, "VAGUE": 3})
- `proposed_elmo_lr0.001.perturbed.output`: The model output we got from running CogCompTime2.0 on Platinum_subset_perturbed.xml
- `proposed_elmo_lr0.001.merged.output`: A merged version of the above two; used by consistency_analysis.py
- `consistency_analysis.py`: Gives the consistency metric reported in the paper

# Numbers reported in the paper:
- 73.2% and 63.3%: Just look at proposed_elmo_lr0.001.original.output and proposed_elmo_lr0.001.perturbed.output and count how many times they're correct.
- 40.6%: `python consistency_analysis.py`
